- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, My name is Dhrupad @DpD-Nightmare, and I am an AI, ML, and intelligent control system Consultant and project developer.
    - I completed projects based on AI, ML, and DL modeling using the python & R programming languages. I also write various articles on topics of AI and the Usage of data in the modern world.
    - I have completed the modeling of several Machine learning algorithm by using programming languages python libs and R packages like(sklearn ml modals, TensorFlow, and hardcoding by using Numpy)
    - The projects are base on deep learning's multilayer perceptron models, Convolution neural networks(CNN) models for various regression and classification tasks, the NLP model's transformers like Glow_dataset, world to vec dataset. I worked on the audio-based dataset and their feature extraction from the audio dataset and used that data in DNN models for various purposes. I  also have project experience on time-series-based data for visualization and prediction using RNN & LSTM models.

- ðŸ‘€ I have completed my Master of Engineering(in the field of Automatic control and robotics) from M.S Univesity Baroda in the year 2020
