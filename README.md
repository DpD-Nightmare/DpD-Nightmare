- ðŸ‘‹ "My name is Dhrupad Patel. I specialize in AI & ML algorithms and have completed a variety of projects using Python and R programming languages. My expertise includes machine learning models such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow, as well as deep learning models like multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. I have applied these models to various classification and regression tasks, including natural language processing projects using transformer models and audio datasets. Additionally, I have experience working with time series data for visualization and prediction using RNN and LSTM models.

- I hold a Master of Engineering degree in Automatic Control and Robotics from M.S. University Baroda, and I have a strong foundation in advanced engineering concepts. I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and approaches in the field and continually strive to enhance my skills and knowledge.

- Throughout my career, I have worked on a wide range of projects, including e-commerce consumer data analysis, online retailer consumer supply-demand analysis, electric fraud consumer analysis, P&ID object detection for automation processes, resume parsing, deception detection, and data-driven agricultural development. These projects have involved the use of a variety of tools and techniques, such as Tableau, Business Analytics, MySQL, data scraping, clustering, SVM, image processing, deep learning, computer vision, PyTorch, NLP, NER, Tkinter, Flask, Spacy, Docker, word2vec, and OpenSMILE.
