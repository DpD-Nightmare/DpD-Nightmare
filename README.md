- ðŸ‘‹ "My name is Dhrupad Patel. I specialize in AI, ML, and data science and have completed a variety of projects using Python and R programming languages. My expertise includes machine learning models such as sklearn and TensorFlow, as well as deep learning models such as multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural networks. I have applied these models to various classification and regression tasks, including natural language processing projects using transformer models and audio datasets. I have also worked with time series data for visualization and prediction using RNN and LSTM models.

- I hold a Master of Engineering degree in Automatic Control and Robotics from M.S. University Baroda and have a strong foundation in advanced engineering concepts. I am dedicated to staying current with the latest technologies and approaches in the field and am always looking to further develop my skills and knowledge.

- I have worked on a range of projects including e-commerce consumer data analysis, online retailer consumer supply-demand analysis, electric fraud consumer analysis, P&ID object detection automation process, resume parser, deception detection, and data-driven agricultural development. These projects have involved using a variety of tools and techniques such as Tableau, Business Analytics, MySQL, data scraping, clustering, SVM, image processing, DL, CV, Pytorch, NLP, NER, Tkinter, Flask, Spacy, Docker, word2vec, and OpenSMILE.
